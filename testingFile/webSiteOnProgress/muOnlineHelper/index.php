		<center>May 20 2019</center>
		<div class="contbox">
			<p>
				It doesn’t get much bigger than MU Origin in the mobile MMORPG world. This acclaimed spinoff of Webzen’s MU Online has been dominating the Asian charts for the last couple of years, so the announcement earlier this year that MU Origin 2 is on the way was a big deal.<br><br>

				And now we have the release date: May 28th, which is less than two weeks from now.<br><br>

				MU Origin 2 will take the long-established MU universe and update it in all the important ways, with souped-up visuals, richer gameplay, and a more expansive world.<br><br>

				After choosing your class – Dark Knight, Dark Wizard, or Elf – you’ll embark on an epic journey, conquering dungeons, completing quests, progressing through the story campaign, and taking on human opponents in a variety of modes.
