			<h4>Day Trip to Rila Monastery</h4><hr>
		
			<p>The Rila Monastery is the largest and most famous Eastern Orthodox monastery in Bulgaria. It is situated in the northwestern RilaMountains, in the deep valley of the RilskaRiver, at an elevation of 1,147 m above sea level. Founded in the 10th century, the Rila Monastery is regarded as one of Bulgaria’s most important cultural and historical monuments and is on account of this also a key tourist attraction.
Rila Monastery Church is richly decorated in frescoes and icons. The tower beside the church is the only original structure from the 14th century remaining on the Rila Monastery complex.
One of the most interesting pieces at the Rila Monastery Museum is Rafail’s cross, a cross carved and whittled with needles for over more than a decade to produce minute biblical scenes. You will also see artifacts from the original monastery, such as icons and manuscripts.
It’s possible to hike from the monastery to see the actual cave in which John of Rila stayed for two decades. Legend has it that those able to pass through a hole in the rock are free of sin. Many pilgrims do this as a part of religious ritual, and the rock has since worn smooth
