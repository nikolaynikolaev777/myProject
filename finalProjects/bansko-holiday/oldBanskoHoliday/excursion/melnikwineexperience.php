			<h4>Melnik Wine Experience</h4><hr>
		
			<p>Bansko Life offers an unmissable day trip to the glorious wine producing region of Melnik.
Just under an hours drive from Bansko and the winemakers from Villa Melnik are waiting to give you a warm welcome. Melnik is in the Western part of Bulgaria, close to the border with Greece.
The smallest town in Bulgaria, Melnik, is nested in the south slopes of Pirin, only 30 km from the borderline with Greece. The finds from the antiquity discovered upon the archaeological diggings testify for its centuries-old history.
The first written evidences for the Melnik Fortress refer to the beginning of the 11th century. The first settlers on the territory of contemporary Melnik were the Thracians, and more particularly the Thracian tribe Maedi, of which the legendary rebel Spartacus originated. In 1215 Melnik turned into a capital of an independent feudal principality but in 1395 the Bulgarian lands, as well as Melnik, fell under Ottoman Dominion for whole 5 centuries.
During the 18th century, in the age of the Bulgarian Revival, the town was raised for new life. Melnik turned into a blooming, significant in size and population town, with a large market. The local tradespeople were selling their goods in Budapest, Wien, Genoa, Venice. Melnik also became famous in entire Europe for its good wine, with which it is famous even nowadays.
As a center of the ecclesiastic life in the region was recognized the Rozhen Monastery. It is the largest Orthodox monastery in the Pirin region. The monastery is comparatively well preserved to the present day and every year it is visited by many tourists from various countries.
Melnik is declared a natural and architectural reservation, and it attracts thousands of tourists annually. The wine which is produced by the unique Bulgarian brand Wide Melnik Vine has a wonderful quality, scents of ripe cherry, herbs, and in the presence of an oak it develops nuances of tobacco and leather. It is one of the attractions of the town and the region, and it attracts many admirers from the whole world.
You will enjoy the picturesque scenery and nature in front of the Villa, as well as the affable winemakers from the winery. They are hard-working and they produce uniquely-flavoured wines, but they are also very keen on telling you about the production process from the vines to the served bottle on the table, ready to be tasted. The quality, care and precision of wine production in Villa Melnik, presented by the winemakers, are of the highest standard. The winery is unique due to the care with which fruits are processed and taste is cultivated and preserved. Villa Melnik is an excellent example of rustic Bulgarian architecture, which very well accompanies the beautiful scenery of Macedonic Bulgaria and the typically Bulgarian vines. A sunset view from the Tasting Tables, overlooking the lush vineyards is enriched by the unique flavour of Villa Melnikâ€™s wines. A must see!
