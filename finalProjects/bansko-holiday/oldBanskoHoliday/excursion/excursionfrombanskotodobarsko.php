			<h4>Excursion from Bansko to Dobarsko</h4><hr>
		
			<p>The village of Dobarsko has gained global fame not only for its enthralling natural scenery, celebrated folk choir of the Dobarsko Grannies and quite tasty homemade food. The place not far from the skiing resort of Bansko, Southwestern Bulgaria, has emerged as a rural tourism destination since the beginning of 21 c. The reason: its stone church with frescoes dated 400 years ago. Among them there are two dismaying frescoes of Jesus Christ depicted in something that looks like a spaceship.

The church in Dobarsko is very distinct from average Orthodox churches. Seen from outside, the stone structure built in 1614 as a three-knave basilica is not necessarily impressive. In 1978 when restorers began a project for its renovation, its walls were covered with a thick soot layer. After they cleaned them up they were dismayed with the vibrant depiction of biblical scenes and the animated faces of saints, so vivid and perfect that they remind of the masterpieces of Renaissance artist Giotto. Instead of pale-faced martyrs as the canons of Christian painting require, the church’s walls are inhabited by good-looking youthful figures fraught with light and joy.

The church has yet another mystery, and it has to do with the healing waters of the spring in the churchyard. Visitors often queue there carrying bottles and tubes. “The spring’s debit neither grows nor decreases and it never freezes, even on coldest of days”, Nikola Naydenov says. “Its water is quite helpful in the treatment of eye diseases.”
Visiting the oldest church in Bulgaria. Transport by car to the church in Dobarsko and back to Bansko. A visit to the church and sightseeing inside and outside. That church is the oldest in Bulgaria.</p><hr>
